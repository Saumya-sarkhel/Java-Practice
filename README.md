# 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

Welcome to the Java world. This repository contains a collection of Java programs designed for beginners to get hands-on practice with core Java concepts. The examples are structured in a way to gradually build a foundational understanding of programming using Java.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `Java-basic` This folder contains all the Basic Concepts about Java
- `src`: This folder has sources code of some basic programs
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.(Removed .class files to make it clean and simple)

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Java installed. You can compile and run any file using the following commands:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName

```
