## Use of 'is' in Java:-
Laptop is a computer.
It means that a laptop contains all features that a computer exhibits.
Through IS, we try to take the features of something.

## Inheritance:-
1. One class can inherit the properties and features of another class.
2. Inheritance is a type of feature in Java through which we can copy properties to a class from an upper class.
3. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class.
4. Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

## In inheritance, there are two types of classes:-
1. Parent class/ Superclass/ Base class
2. Child class/ Subclass/ Derived class

Parent class: The class whose properties are inherited.
Child class: The class which inherits the properties of others.
Child class accesses the features of a parent class.

## Need of an Inheritance:-
Inheritance supports reusability. We can derive a new class from an existing class by including some features from the existing class.

## Points related to inheritance in Java:-

- The superclass of every class is an Object class.
- In the absence of any other explicit superclass, every class is implicitly a subclass of the Object class.
- A superclass can have any number of subclasses but a subclass can have only one superclass.
- Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.
- A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class.

## Types of Inheritance

1. **Simple Inheritance**:
   One class extends another class.

2. **Multi Inheritance**:
   One class extends more than one class.

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**:
   One class is inherited from many class.

4. **Hybrid Inheritance**:
   Both Multi and Hierarchical Inheritance.
